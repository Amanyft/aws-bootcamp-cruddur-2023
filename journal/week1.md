  <h3>The different elements of a dockerfile structure :</h3> 
     <b> FROM </b> Base Image  : A Dockerfile starts with a base image, which is the foundation of the new Docker image . It contains a pre-built and pre-configured operating system with all its dependencies, libraries, and software packages needed to run that image .<br>
     <b> ENV </b> Environment Variables : The ENV command is used to set environment variables within the Docker image.<br>
     <b> COPY  <Source> <Dest> </b>  : used to copy files or directories from the host machine (where Docker is running) into the Docker image being built.<br>
     <b> WORKDIR </b> : used to set the working directory for subsequent instructions.<br>
     <b> RUN </b> : used to execute a command in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. <br>
     <b> EXPOSE </b> : used to specify which ports are exposed by the Docker image.<br>
     <b>CMD</b> : used to specify the default command that should be run when a container based on the Docker image is started . <br>
  
  <h3>The difference between Container OS and Host OS </h3>
  
  - A container OS is typically a lightweight, stripped-down version of a full-fledged operating system that includes only the minimum software and services required to run a container. This includes the container runtime, system libraries, and other dependencies needed to run applications in the container.<br>
  - A Host OS is a complete operating system that runs directly on the host machine and provides a wide range of services and capabilities to support a variety of applications. <br>

  * The use of Docker compose file to build both of the App containers at the same time . <br>

  <h3> Docker Container security Best practices :</h3>
           -Managed Container Services VS Unmanaged Container Services .<br>
                Managed Container Services and Unmanaged Container Services are two different approaches to running and managing containerized applications.<br>
                Managed container services are fully managed platforms that provide a turnkey solution for running and managing containers.<br>
                Examples of managed container services include Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS...<br>
           -Unmanaged Container Services: <br>
            Unmanaged container services require you to manage the underlying infrastructure yourself .<br>
            Examples of unmanaged container services include Docker Swarm, Kubernetes on-premises, and OpenShift.<br>
            
           -Docker architecture(components): docker client , docker server ,Docker registry , Docker container, docker image .
